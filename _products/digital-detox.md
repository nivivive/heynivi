# If you are
- Endlessly scrolling through your phone, over and over again, with no real purpose
- Stuck in a cycle of chasing likes and comments on your social media posts
- Anxious about disconnecting from work, but still checking work email well after your work day is over
- Yearning for a proper break at the weekends. but still stuck to your screens
- Stressed out seeing everyone on Instagram leading idyllic lives, with happy partners, perfect children and cute puppies

And you want a personalized and resilient **system** to change that, then this challenge is made for you.

# The 30-day challenge
During the 30-day challenge, you will systematically assess, troubleshoot, and bring your Internet experience back into your control. You will also have access to your personal coach ([me!](https://heynivi.com/about)) and learn to apply the latest neuroscience and behavioral psychology insights synthesized from over 15 leading experts, including Charles Duhigg, BJ Fogg, and James Clear, applied to **your** specific problems. (The research alone is more than $300, 4500 pages, and 125 hours.)

You'll have access to:
- **30** daily emails with a bite-sized action item and a checkin to help you assess and troubleshoot (10 min each)
- **4** weekly 1:1s with me (30 min each) 
- Access to a group chat with other challenge participants

# Next steps
If you're interested in joining our group starting Oct 1, then you can signup by sending me $3 on [venmo](https://venmo.com/nivivive) with a note saying "{{ page.title }} - *Your name*, *Your email*".

P.S. Make the note private unless you want random people emailing you!

# FAQ

## Why are you asking me to venmo you $3?
You're probably have lots of things demanding your attention every day. In order for you to have any chance at all of succeeding at the challenge, you have to really commit to it. 

The $3 is a commitment device.

If you're not willing to put in the price of a single cup of tea (or coffee), then you're likely not ready to commit.

## Why are you asking for my name and email?
I'm going to be your personal coach during the challenge. It'll be great if I have a way to talk with you and know how to address you!

## I'm not ready yet.
That's ok! You can start to get your feet warm by checking out my [Designed to Addict](https://heynivi.com) articles, which shares general tactics and strategies to resolve your digital addictions.
