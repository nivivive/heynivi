You're stuck at home or exhausted after work. We know what that means...

You intended to just watch one episode of Friends or Away, but then you couldn't stop...

Before you knew it, you ended up watching the entire season.

Sound familiar?

Chances are, *you're addicted to Netflix*. And Netflix wants that for you. But do you want that for yourself?

In hindsight, it's not *that* surprising that Netflix wants you to be addicted to its services.

After all, Netflix is a for-profit business that makes money on your monthly subscription. And, in order to Netflix to make money, *they* need *you* to find their subscription **valuable enough** to not cancel at the end of each month. They're also competing with a number of other television and streaming services which are all also competing for your attention.

Whether you want to stop watching Netflix altogether or just limit your usage of it, I've found a number of small but effective strategies that can help you re-design your Netflix habit.

P.S. The secret to using this guide is to pick 1-3 of the strategies that you think will be the *best* for *you* specifically and do those *first*. Then, learn and iterate as needed.

# Eliminate cues in your environment
*When* do you watch Netflix? Is it every day right after work? Or when you sit down to eat dinner?

*Where* do you watch it? In your bed? In the living room? On your laptop? On your tablet/phone? 

Figure out what your Netflix routine looks like. Then, disrupt it by re-designing your environment and hiding the signals that tell you to go on Netflix.

## Unsubscribe from notifications
If you receive email or push notifications from Netflix, then disable them.
Likewise, if you follow Netflix on social media or check out what's new and upcoming on your streaming apps, unsubscribe from them.

These notifications can create a craving for you to come back to the app and check out new releases from Netflix. By getting rid of them, you're making it harder to Netflix to steal your attention.

## Delete Netflix (or other streaming apps) from your devices
Delete the Netflix shortcut on your Chrome New Tabs page. Hide or delete the Netflix app on your phone/tablet.

That way, if you're bored and looking for what to do next, Netflix is not the first thing you see and decide to use.

## Create a Netflix zone
Limit Netflix to one place and one device. For example, in your living room on your Roku.

That's your Netflix zone. Everywhere else is not.

# Find alternatives to your Netflix craving
We typically watch TV as a form of wish fulfillment. So, take a look at the kind of TV shows you watch, the people in them that you resonate with, and why you do that.

Then, find healthier alternatives to getting that in real life instead.

For example, my wish fulfillment fantasy is around having a clear path to success -- I love watching people starting off imperfect, and becoming better with hard work and the support of people around them. So, when I take little steps towards getting better and can visibly see that, the value of TV diminishes drastically.

## Figure out your wish fulfillment desires
Luckily, Netflix has done a lot of extensive research on their subscribers and what kinds of content they should surface. They've broken down their market into taste clusters, people who like the same kind of things. 

Netflix uses this to figure out what shows you're likely to watch and what images or taglines motivate you to select that show.

In one of the [experiments](https://netflixtechblog.com/selecting-the-best-artwork-for-videos-through-a-b-testing-f6155c4595f6) they ran for the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt TV show, they ultimately selected the last image as the most clickable.

![Netflix experiments](https://miro.medium.com/max/638/0*BgJS5jRKzpW2MnB8.){: .center }

But, you can also use your past Netflix browsing history to figure out the genre or type of shows you like to watch and why. Then, find healthier long-term alternatives.

## The emotion behind the craving
How do you feel right before you want to watch Netflix?

Bored? Try picking up a more active hobby. Maybe its making new recipes, or learning a new language, or playing tennis.

Stressed? Take a few long breaths. Try meditating, going for a walk, or journaling instead.

Tired? Try sleeping. If you can't sleep, then at least turn off the lights and close your eyes to rest them for a few moments.

## Limit your access to Netflix's default alternative
Decide what you want to watch before going to Netflix. Don't look at the discovery page.

Netflix auto-plays the teasers to make you more curious and likely to click, but you can [opt](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2102) out of that.

Recently, I heard Netflix rolled out a [Shuffle button](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/netflix-test-puts-a-shuffle-play-button-right-on-your-home-screen/#:~:text=Netflix's%20new%20%E2%80%9CShuffle%E2%80%9D%20feature%20could,it%20thinks%20you'll%20like.) to suggest shows to users that don't know what they want to watch. If you're feeling like you're addicted to Netflix, do **not** click that. That's only going to make the problem worse.

# Take advantage of your laziness üòõ
Create some space between your craving to watch Netflix and your routine of watching Netflix by making it slightly harder to watch Netflix. You might decide that it's not worth the extra effort and can reduce your watching.

## Disable autoplay
Since 2013, when Netflix began releasing its own original series, it also started releasing all the episodes in a season at once. Making it easy for people to binge-watch all the episodes at once. When you binge-watch your favorite show, your brain will continually produce dopamine and make you feel a drug-like high as you form a pseudo-addiction to that show.

When you watch an episode in a series, Netflix auto-plays the next episode in the series by default. You can [disable](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/2102) that.

Next time, you'll have to make a conscious decision on whether you want to watch the next episode.

## Logout every time
Logout of Netflix after each session. Bonus points for not using a password manager to remember the password for you and also to use a long password.

That way, you can use the time it takes for you to log back in to decide if its worth it.

## Stack your habits
James Clear talks about a technique called 'habit stacking' in his book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits).

It goes like this.

**Before:** You watch Netflix ‚ùå

**After:** You watch Netflix for 30 min ‚ùå -> Do 10 pushups to earn 30 more min ‚úÖ

**OR** Do 10 pushups ‚úÖ -> Watch Netflix for 30 min ‚ùå

You might discover that you like doing pushups more than Netflix and stop watching Netflix. Or you might get too lazy to do the pushups and so you don't watch more Netflix. Either way, it's a win-win.

# Make Netflix less satisfying
## Find a dull moment between bingeable content and cliff-hangers
Netflix is a data-driven company. And they analyze *a lot* of your data.

They track when you watch (hour and day), where you watch (zip code), how you watch (pause / rewind / fast forward), and [more.](https://gigaom.com/2012/06/14/netflix-analyzes-a-lot-of-data-about-your-viewing-habits/)

Netflix uses this data to decide which shows to produce and how to produce them to be bingeable. 

Every TV show, on Netflix or off, ends each episode with a cliffhanger. And we know why they do this.

It's to keep you on the edge of your seat and curious on what happens next.

TV series producers are becoming better at delivering addicting content all time, but they're not perfect. Also, as we (the users) get used to higher content quality, we develop a threshold.

There will be a dull moment or two in the middle of each episode. As soon as you feel the lull, stop watching. Don't watch the episode til the end.

A slightly better way to do this is to set a timer to end 10-15 min before the end of the episode and stop watching then. Don't worry -- Netflix will remember where you left off and let you pick it back up on another day.

## Turn on [grayscale]({{site.url}}/quarantine-your-screen-time#2-make-the-internet-less-rewarding)
For survival reasons, color is incredibly compelling to us humans. But you don't need Netflix for survival.

So, take color away from Netflix. That might kill most of the value you find in it.
