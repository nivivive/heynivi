It seems like when the pandemic started, the world went fully digital.

Work happened online. School happened online. And social interactions too.

And some of this was great! People got creative. A lot of banana bread was made and eaten. People got closer to their quaranteams. People grew resilient.

But for a lot of others, theyâ€™ve noticed work and not work life start to insidiously blur and their screen time skyrocket as they spent many, many more hours just wasting time on the Internet. 

If that's you, you're not alone. You, me, and [75% of US households](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11878327/american-families-need-digital-detox/), and [countless](https://www.adnews.com.au/news/the-coronavirus-lockdown-is-forcing-us-to-view-screen-time-differently) [others](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/lockdown-leads-to-surge-in-tv-screen-time-and-streaming) [worldwide](https://www.google.com/search?q=pandemic+digital+addictions&sxsrf=ALeKk02w8TCMLsUu1AzFOh9ZUdaf3eTTgg:1600882670317&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvk5DX6P_rAhWXtZ4KHdszCwMQ_AUIDigA&biw=720&bih=771&dpr=1) desperately want a digital detox but are at a loss to do during quarantine when there's so many reasons to be online<!--more-->.

# Problem
The problem with the Internet is that it's not just one thing. There's [more than a billion](https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) different apps and websites on your phone, laptop, and any other digital device you own.

And the problem with trying to fix this all at once is that your brain is on autopilot.

With over [100 trillion](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/numbers-the-nervous-system-from-268-mph-signals-to-trillions-of-synapses) different signals that your brain has to process, it has to be. A lot of the things that keep your body running and you alive are just happening in the background as a result of things that your brain already has on autopilot because of your genes or something you decided a while back through something called the habit loop.

# Why does this matter?
If we know how your brain put your Internet habits on autopilot, then we can re-design it so that the autopilot strategy leaves feeling less overwhelmed and back on top of the world!

# How does it work?
Thanks to the neuroscience and behavioral psychology research compiled by [Charles Duhigg](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU) and [James Clear](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break-ebook/dp/B07D23CFGR), we know that when all steps in the habit loop are performed effectively, the routine you perform gets on the brain's autopilot master plan. If you feel happy about the routine, then that's great. Now the brain will make it easy for you to keep doing it without wasting any willpower. If you don't, then you now have a bad addiction in your hands.

The four steps of the habit loop are:
1. Cue - Triggers your brain to initiate a behavior when it anticipates a reward
2. Craving - The motivational force behind a habit that makes you want the reward
3. Routine - The behavior that you perform to get the reward
4. Reward - The value you get from the routine that satisfies the craving

For example, when you wake up (cue), you want to feel informed (craving) so you check your email (routine) and become informed (reward).

Every time this loop happens, you gets a dopamine hit and the habit is reinforced. So, if you hijack the loop, you can wean off any habit.

# The Internet habit
There is no one single Internet habit. That's because we can use the Internet whenever, go to whichever website/app we want to, use it for whatever reward, and satisfy whatever craving we have. So, in reality, you're probably trying to tackle 50 Internet habits, not just one.

# Solution
The strategy I've used to solve this is fairly straightforward. First, awareness. During the awareness stage, we're also going to be able to easily nip some bad Internet habits in the bud. Second, targeting. During the targeting stage, we're going to look at the ways specific apps/websites reinforce the habit loop and how to rewire that.

![Awareness habit loop and targeting habit loops]({{ site.url }}/img/loop2.png){: .center }

# First, Awareness
We're going to weaken two parts of the habit loop: the routine and the reward. Depending on what your individual habits are, this can get rid of 20-80% of your bad Internet habits.

1. Make the routine of using a (undesirable) website harder
2. Make the internet less rewarding

# 1. Make the routine of using a (undesirable) website harder
We're going to do this by creating a walled garden with your phone and laptop.

If you're using a Macbook, then go to Settings -> Screen Time -> Content and Privacy OR search for "Content and privacy" in your Settings menu. Now, enable "Allowed websites only" under Content.

![How to block 1]({{ site.url }}/img/block1.png){: .center }

If you're on a iPhone, then go to Settings -> Screen Time -> Content & Privacy Restrictions. Enable "Content & Privacy Restrictions". Then, go into Content Restrictions -> Web Content. Now, enable "Allowed Websites Only".

![How to block 2]({{ site.url }}/img/block2.png){: .center .phone }

After enabling this, the first time you try to open a website, you will see that the website is blocked. Think for a moment whether you want to use the website or not. If the answer is yet, then add it to your allowed list.

![How to block 3]({{ site.url }}/img/block3.jpeg){: .center .phone }

If the answer is no, then you're all done! This minor check allowed you to get rid of a shallow Internet habit.

If the answer is mixed -- you want to use it right now, but you don't think it's good in the long term --, then add it to your allowed list anyways. This is clearly a more deeply engrained Internet habit and we'll tackle it separately in the Targeting step.

A couple of notes:
- On your Mac, it's going to ask you for your password every time.
- On your MAC, it also sometimes just says the IP address (e.g. 127.0.0.1) instead of a specific website. 
- If you're someone who needs to go to random websites for work, then you have a couple of options: only do this for your phone, briefly disable "Allowed websites only" for work, or add the random websites to your allowed list for now and then go back at the end of the day/end of week to clean up.

![How to block 4]({{ site.url }}/img/block4.png){: .center }

This can be annoying but 95% of the time, it's just the website you opened or the services it has running in background. You can always check who the website belongs to by typing "whois 127.0.0.1" in your Terminal. When I did this, I just added a bunch of the IPs and then went back to check what it belonged to later. After the first 10 min, the rate of the popups slows down considerably so consider doing this when you have a free 10 minutes.

![How to block 5]({{ site.url }}/img/block5.png){: .center }

To recap, what we've done right now is just made it harder for you to access a website that you don't want to use.

# 2. Make the Internet less rewarding

Everything is more exciting in color. It's true. Google it.

We're going to take it away from the Internet.

In return, you're going to notice how much more exciting everything outside of your phone and laptop is.

If you're using a Macbook, then go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Color Filters OR search for "Color Filters" in the Settings menu. Now, enable "Color Filters" with the "Grayscale" filter.
![How to grayscale 1]({{ site.url }}/img/color1.png){: .center }

If you're using an iPhone, then go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size. Scroll down to Color Filters. Now, enable "Color Filters" with the "Grayscale" filter.
![How to grayscale 2]({{ site.url }}/img/color2.jpeg){: .center .phone }

One note:
- If you're a designer or need color enabled for work, then just disable the "Color Filters" for work and then turn it back on when you're done. Alternatively, only do this for your phone.

# Next, Targeting
I'm planning to spotlight a couple of apps like Netflix and Facebook in the upcoming articles in the Designed to Addict series. As most apps are trying to make money, it's no surprise that they want you on their app more. I will highlight specific parts of each app and in essence, teach you to redesign your Netflix (or insert your vice) addiction.

P.S. If you want a deep dive on a specific app or other feedback, then please [tweet](https://twitter.com/nivivive/status/) it to me!
