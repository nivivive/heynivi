Going online used to be fun. But then the pandemic hit and everything went online.

Always being online is not only exhausting, but feels impossible to prevent.

We work (or go to school) online. We socialize online. And, we watch all our free time vanish online as well.

If you feel like some or a lot of those hours are just wasted on the Internet, then you're not alone.

You, me, and 75% of [US households](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11878327/american-families-need-digital-detox/), and [countless](https://www.adnews.com.au/news/the-coronavirus-lockdown-is-forcing-us-to-view-screen-time-differently) [others](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/lockdown-leads-to-surge-in-tv-screen-time-and-streaming) [worldwide](https://www.google.com/search?q=pandemic+digital+addictions&sxsrf=ALeKk02w8TCMLsUu1AzFOh9ZUdaf3eTTgg:1600882670317&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjvk5DX6P_rAhWXtZ4KHdszCwMQ_AUIDigA&biw=720&bih=771&dpr=1) desperately want a digital detox but are at a loss to do so during quarantine when there's so many reasons to be online.

# The problem with Internet

There are more than a [billion](https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/) different apps and websites available on our phones, laptops, and other digital devices that we own.

There's only one Internet, but infinite ways and reasons to use it. Some good and some bad.

But it is possible to untangle that and develop an un-addiction strategy -- one that enables us to be online for only the productive and happy moments, and not one moment more.

# An ~~addiction?~~ A **habit**!
We don't just get addicted to cigarettes or drugs.

We can get addicted to pretty much anything. And it has to do with with how our brains works.

When you perform any behavior, your brain tracks when you did it (the cue), why you did it (the craving), the behavior itself (the routine), and the result of the behavior (the reward). Any behavior that successfully satisfies a craving results in the release of a chemical known as dopamine and increases the likelihood that you'll repeat this routine again. Over time, it becomes a [habit](https://amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break-ebook/dp/B07D23CFGR) that you perform automatically with very little additional willpower needed. 

This is normally a good thing.

After all, there are over [100 trillion](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/numbers-the-nervous-system-from-268-mph-signals-to-trillions-of-synapses) different signals that our brains have to process.

![100 trillion pieces of information for your brain](https://media.giphy.com/media/qKltgF7Aw515K/giphy.gif){: .center }

And, if we had to process each one manually, then we'd be dead really fast.

Just think about it...you'd have to remember to take a breath every 3 seconds, blink every four seconds, continuously pump blood to your heart, tell your mouth to excrete saliva and then your stomach to digest. And let's not forget only driving when there's a green signal or avoiding an incoming car and on and on.

In short, it's not surprising how much of our decision-making is automated.

# If the brain is so efficient, why do we end up with habits that we don't like?

If you had a heart attack every time you ate bacon, then you'd probably stop eating it right away, right?

But, I bet the last time you ate fries, you probably really enjoyed the contrasting textures of crunchy and chewy and the hot, salty flavor.

![Red meat and heart attacks](https://media.giphy.com/media/gw3CGVEqIhXAmMZa/giphy.gif){: .center }

We end up with bad habits because we still get a dopamine release and happy, pleasurable feelings from those habits in the short term. *In the moment*, our brains **over-value** instant gratification and **under-value** delayed gratification even if the delayed gratification is more valuable in the long run.

# Re-designing our digital addictions
Luckily, we can use what got us addicted to the Internet to also get us un-addicted by hijacking this neurological reinforcement loop üòà 

# First, track and contain
We're going to first figure out what websites you go to today and why by using a setting on your laptop and phone that blocks every website from your devices unless you explicitly allow it back in.

After enabling this setting, if you open a new website, you can quickly decide:

A. I need this website for [a specific reason] and allow it back in.

*This is a good Internet habit that you can leave as-is.*

B. I don't need this website and never let it back in. 

*This is a bad, but weakly reinforced Internet habit. You should be able to easily limit access to this website by just using this setting.*

C. I don't need this website, but I want it anyways for [a specific reason] and allow it back in.

*This is a bad and strongly reinforced Internet habit. It will take more time and experimentation to get rid of. For now, it's critical that to understand your reason for using this website. Note: I will be focusing on specific strategies for C in the upcoming articles.*

## On a Macbook
Go to Settings -> Screen Time -> Content and Privacy OR search for "Content and privacy" in your Settings menu. Now, enable "Allowed websites only" under Content.

![How to block 1]({{ site.url }}/img/block1.png){: .center }

## On an iPhone
Go to Settings -> Screen Time -> Content & Privacy Restrictions. Enable "Content & Privacy Restrictions". Then, go into Content Restrictions -> Web Content. Now, enable "Allowed Websites Only".

![How to block 2]({{ site.url }}/img/block2.png){: .center .phone }

After enabling this, the first time you try to open a website, you will see that the website is blocked. Think for a moment whether you want to use the website or not. If the answer is yes, then add it to your allowed list.

![How to block 3]({{ site.url }}/img/block3.jpeg){: .center .phone }

If the answer is no, then you're all done! This minor check allowed you to get rid of a shallow Internet habit.

If the answer is mixed...as in, you want to use it right now, but you don't think it's good in the long term, then add it to your allowed list anyways. This is clearly a more deeply engrained Internet habit and we'll tackle it later in the upcoming articles.

## A couple of notes
- On your Mac, it's going to ask you for your password every time.
- On your Mac, it also sometimes just says the IP address (e.g. 127.0.0.1) instead of a specific website. 
- If you're someone who needs to go to random websites for work, then you have a couple of options: only do this for your phone, briefly disable "Allowed websites only" for work, or add the random websites to your allowed list for now and then go back at the end of the day/end of week to clean up.

![How to block 4]({{ site.url }}/img/block4.png){: .center }

This can be annoying but 95% of the time, it's just the website you opened or the services it has running in background. You can always check who the website belongs to by typing "whois 127.0.0.1" in your Terminal. When I did this, I just added a bunch of the IPs and then went back to check what it belonged to later. After the first 10 min, the rate of the popups slows down considerably so consider doing this when you have a free 10 minutes.

# Now, suck the joy out of the Internet üò±

Everything is more exciting in color. It's true. Google it.

We're going to take it away from the Internet.

In return, you're going to notice how much more exciting everything (especially nature!) outside of your phone and laptop is.

## On a Macbook
Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Color Filters OR search for "Color Filters" in the Settings menu. Now, enable "Color Filters" with the "Grayscale" filter.

## On an iPhone
Go to Settings -> Accessibility -> Display & Text Size. Scroll down to Color Filters. Now, enable "Color Filters" with the "Grayscale" filter.

## One note:
- If you're a designer or need color enabled for work, then just disable the "Color Filters" for work and then turn it back on when you're done. Alternatively, only do this for your phone.

# P.S.
Next up in the Designed to Addict series is [Redesign Your Netflix Addiction]({{ site.url }}/redesign-netflix).

I'm planning to spotlight a couple more apps like Netflix and Facebook in the upcoming articles in the Designed to Addict series. I'll be breaking down specific design elements of each app and help you re-design you **[insert your vice here]** digital addiciton.

If you want a deep dive on a specific app or have other feedback, then please [tweet](https://twitter.com/nivivive/status/1308856856689995777) it to me!
